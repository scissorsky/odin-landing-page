A landing page coded for The Odin Project.


"The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest." (The Odin Project)


The Odin Project provides images of the design, but the [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) does not require pixel-perfection and allows creative freedom.
